    \begin{itemize}
        \item Best performance: RFR with Unrestricted features (0.757 Pearson correlation).
        \item Key features: \textit{WordNet-Augmented Overlap} and \textit{Character n-grams}.
        \item Lexical and String-based features encode most of the relevant information for STS.
        \item Combining feature types (Lexical, Syntactic, Strings) significantly boosts performance.
    \end{itemize}
