# Introduction
In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of various types of features in predicting Semantic Text Similarity (STS) through Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and Support Vector Regressors (SVRs). We evaluate lexical features, syntactic features, and purely string-related features, to examine their relative contributions to the STS prediction performance of the models.
